		<p>Machine Learning With JavaScript - How It Works And How To Use It (via BrainJS)</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” ~Arthur C. Clarke</p>
		<p>If machine learning seems like magic to you or if you’ve got theoretical understanding but never actually used a neural network, this presentation will be for you.</p>
		<p>For years I’ve been fascinated with machine learning: the algorithms, the potential, and the increasing accessibility, but struggled to climb the learning curve long enough to actually building something with it. I want to help you avoid that and get you into the world of machine learning as quickly and painlessly as possible. While better libraries may exist, BrainJS is easy to use out of the box, has great documentation, and... well you’ll see!</p>

		<h2>Topic</h2>
		<p>WebAssembly</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>WebAssembly is a new cross-browser emerging standard providing a "target bytecode" for languages that want to compile into something that can be run natively inside the browser; in many ways, it's the culmination of the effort to provide developers with an ability to do "browser plug-ins" without having to be browser-specific, alongside the safety and portability of the Java applet or Flash game. In this talk, we'll go over some of the different tools of the WebAssembly world, talk briefly about what WebAssembly does--and doesn't--provide, and look at how to get started using WebAssembly while we wait to see how the world reacts and/or moves to adopt this in a more widespread fashion.</p>

		<p>PKG FTW!</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Many problems can be solved with code and automating someone's work by performing a complex task when they need. It creates consistency in a process and ensures the work gets done correctly. But, often simple solutions don't warrant creating a full scale application that needs hosting and ongoing support. Instead, using a simple app like PKG one can create easily distributable and simply installable applications to empower non-developers in their work without needing to setup complex solutions.</p>

		<p>What's All The Fuss About Serverless?</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Dude, where's my server?! The word 'Serverless' can be a bit misleading, but this architecture style has exploded in the tech industry and offers a myriad of unique benefits. Unfortunately, real comprehension of this concept has been abstracted away just as much as the server—turning the word 'Serverless' into little more than marketing jargon. In this talk we'll define Serverless, discuss the benefits/compromises, go over real-world use cases, examine the Serverless economy, and I'll demonstrate how to start building with Serverless.</p>
