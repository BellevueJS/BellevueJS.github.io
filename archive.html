		<p>What's All The Fuss About Serverless?</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Dude, where's my server?! The word 'Serverless' can be a bit misleading, but this architecture style has exploded in the tech industry and offers a myriad of unique benefits. Unfortunately, real comprehension of this concept has been abstracted away just as much as the serverâ€”turning the word 'Serverless' into little more than marketing jargon. In this talk we'll define Serverless, discuss the benefits/compromises, go over real-world use cases, examine the Serverless economy, and I'll demonstrate how to start building with Serverless.</p>
