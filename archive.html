The reality is, there is a lot more to consider when your system has legacy code and a business that can't sit and wait while the code is migrated. In this talk I’m going to walk through a strategy to successfully manage the migration. Covering various scenarios you will encounter and present ways to overcome them.</p>

		<p>What's All The Fuss About Serverless?</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Dude, where's my server?! The word 'Serverless' can be a bit misleading, but this architecture style has exploded in the tech industry and offers a myriad of unique benefits. Unfortunately, real comprehension of this concept has been abstracted away just as much as the server—turning the word 'Serverless' into little more than marketing jargon. In this talk we'll define Serverless, discuss the benefits/compromises, go over real-world use cases, examine the Serverless economy, and I'll demonstrate how to start building with Serverless.</p>
