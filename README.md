Topic: Building Websites

Speaker: Andrew McAllister

Description: Using Google's in browser editor to write sample Google Add-ons can be handy for extremely basic scripts, but gets clunky fast when developers want to do something like version control their code or have more than one person working on a script. With the help of a couple open source projects, developers can now build Add-ons on locally, on their own machines, with the tools they're most comfortable with.
